# Hydra-game
A simulation and mathematical analysis of the values used to complete an instance of the [Hydra Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_game). Specifically,
this implementation uses the Lowest Head selection method and a N=step_number children growing from the grandparent node. It generates the initial tree using
one head at an increasing height.
